# Quarto for collaborative research

## why geek out on Quarto?

- [This is why!](https://quinnasena.github.io/resbaz2022/template_complete.html)

- [and this](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/)

- [But is it taking over?](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)

## why I like Quarto

- [Well documented](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)

- Uses [markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)

- Accepts multiple programming languages

- Outputs multiple formats (Word, PDF HTML...)

- Easy to learn and transfer skills from other languages


## another thing to learn?
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- R Markdown and Jupyter also support multiple languages too...

- You decide ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ

## why collaborate via Quarto and Git?

- Version control your projects

- Reproducibility: whole workflow from data to results in one place

- Host a live link consistent with current results (no more copy paste 7 plots into a word doc each time you change something!)

- Coding colaborators can contribute via a Git workflow

- Communicate results to non-coding collaborators

# Buckle up, ready your coding fingers!

## today's goals

- Learn the necessary components of a Quarto document for HTML

- Publish an example link on GitHub

- Have a working template you can use in the future

- Know where to find help and useful resources

## Zoom

- Camera optional, but we love to see you (really, it helps me a lot!)

- During exercises, give me a :heavy_check_mark: when you are done or a :hand: if you need help

- Drop questions in the Zoom chat or raise a hand at any time

- We support inclusivity and a positive environment through the Code of Conduct

## first things first

- Open up VS Code and navigate to the source control
  - Clone the repo: https://github.com/QuinnAsena/resbaz2022.git

- Publish repo to your own GitHub account

- Open up the template.qmd file

:::{.callout-note}
We are using VS Code, R, and GitHub. If you have a preferred workflow like RStudio, Python, or GitKraken you can use them but may be harder to follow the session content. Afterall, Quarto is supposed to be flexible!
:::

## elements of a Quarto file

:::{.incremental}
- YAML

- Text

- Code blocks

- References file

- scss (optional for style; won't cover this!)
:::

## YAML

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
The YAML is a set of `key: value pairs` that are the metadata for your document, such as, author, title, output format, and citation file.

- YAML is whitespace sensitive

- Indent sensitive
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
``` yaml
---
title: "My Manuscript"
format: html
date: today
---
```
:::
::::

## YAML exercise

Your Turn :computer: :

:::{.callout-tip}
# YAML exersice (3 minutes)
- Open up the template.qmd and fill the `title: ` and `name: ` and `affiliation: ` fieds.

  - A couple of handy entries are already completed

  - The existing field: `date: today` will automatically generate today's date (cool huh?  ͡▀̿ ̿ ͜ʖ ͡▀̿ ̿ )

- Add a table of contents following the [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html)

- Render the document

- Give me a :heavy_check_mark: when done or a :hand: if you need help
:::

## text editing

- Writing in Quarto uses [markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) 

- LaTeX is used to render PDFs so LaTeX commands can be used for PDF outputs

- Look! I can do fancy maths: $f_{c}=z^{2}+c$
  - ▀̿ ̿ ͜ʖ ͡▀̿ ̿ 

:::{.callout-note}
# Pro tip!
Render regularly. Small errors can be tricky to pick out long after they have been made.

## including a bibliography

Citations require:

- a `.bib` or `.bibtex` file in your working directory (one is included for today)

  - The references file can be generated (and automatically sync) with Zotero and other reference managers.

- a YAML entry pointing to the file `bibliography: refs.bib` (if the file is named 'refs.bib')

- an optional `CSL` file specifying the format of the bibliography.

  - Useful for authoring articles as `CSL` files are [downloadable for specific journals](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles)

## in-text citations

Citing work in-text [follows the `@citekey` format](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#inserting-citations)

- `@perkel2022` = @perkel2022

- `[@chamberlin1897; @perkel2022]` = [@chamberlin1897; @perkel2022]

- Quarto, by default, inserts a formatted reference list at the end of the document so I put an empty 'References' header.

We won't go deeper into citations for now as we are not authoring an article today. The link above has info for technical writing.

## equations

Pretty, formatted equations can be inserted using the same syntax as in LaTeX. Inline equations (e.g., $E = mc^2$) are surrounded by a `$` and equation bocks are surrounded by `$$`:

$$
N_{t+1} = N_t + r_{d}N_t \left(1- \frac{N_t}{K} \right)
$$

## handy features

The RStudio IDE has some handy features using the visual editor:

- [Visual R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/)

- [Content editing](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/content.html)

- [Technical writing](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.htm)

VS Code also has cool features:

- [Like YAML intelligence](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html#yaml-intelligence)

## markdown exercise

:::{.callout-tip}
# Markdown exercise (5-7 minutes)

- Check out [Quarto's markdown guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)

- and the [biostats guide to writing (equations section)](https://biostats-r.github.io/biostats/quarto/04-figures-tables.html#equations)

In the template Introduction section take 3-4 minutes to write:

- a sub-heading under the introduction

- a list

- and an equation

- cite one of the articles in in existing `.bib` file using the `@`

- render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom
:::


## code blocks

Code is executed when the document is rendered. Code blocks can also be executed individually just like regular R markdown if you are already familiar with that. Code blocks are inserted like this:
```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false
6*7
```

## execution option

Code block execution options options are set with a special comment: `#| ` (white space sensitive!). [Block options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) determine how the code is executed, e.g., whether to display the code block: `#| echo: true`, warning messages `#| warning: false`, and to input captions `#| fig-cap: "A really good figure caption!"`.

:::{.callout-note}
# Pro tip!
Unlike R markdown, block options are lower case true/false and the comment `#| ` must be followed by a space.
:::

## inline code

Code can also be executed inline:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
cat("``` markdown\n")
cat("Seven times six is `r 7 * 6`")
cat("\n```")
```

Inline code execution can be helpful referencing values in text like: there are `nrow(data)` observations in the data.

## code exercise

:::{.callout-tip}
# Code block exercise (5-7 minutes)

- Check out the [execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) and edit the existing code block options in the 'Libraries section' to:

 - display the results

 - exclude the code

 - include a figure caption

 - render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom

## tabsets {.scrollable}

Ok now the feature I find *very* useful: tabsets. Tabsets are great for showing, multiple results, data, code, whatever you want in tabs. Say you want to show the plot on one tab and the model output table in the next, or multiple related plots. Much easier to read and flick among results than a long stream of plots and tables.

:::{. panel-tabset}
# Code
```{r tabsetPlot}
#| echo: true

library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
# From: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species,
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
)
```

# Data
```{r}
rmarkdown::paged_table(penguins[1:50,])
```

# Plot
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins
#| fig-alt: Plot of penguin bill length against body mass by species

mass_flipper
```

## Tabset code

Tabsets are created by:

```quarto
:::{. panel-tabset}
# Tab 1
content

# Tab 2
content
:::

```

## Let'g go Git it

You're now ready to host your first live link!

:::{.callout-tip}
# GitHub

- Render your project so that most recent changes are included in the HTML

- In the source control on the left commit and push your changes
 
  - You can do this however you prefer, commandline, GUI, source control...

- Head over to GitHub in your browser and go:

  - Settings -> GitHub pages -> enable github pages

- By default, your link will be hosted at: https://githubusername.github.io/reponame/pathtodocument.html
