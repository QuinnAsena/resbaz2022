:::{.callout-tip}
# YAML exersice (3 minutes)
- Fill the `title: ` and `name: ` and `affiliation: ` fieds.

  - a couple of handy entries are already completed

  - the existing field: `date: today` will automatically generate today's date (cool huh?  ͡▀̿ ̿ ͜ʖ ͡▀̿ ̿ )

- Add a table of contents following the [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html)

- Remove this callout block and render the document

- Give me a :heavy_check_mark: when done or a :hand: if you need help

# Introduction

:::{.callout-tip}
# Markdown exercise (5-7 minutes)

- Check out [Quarto's markdown guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)

- and the [biostats guide to writing (equations section)](https://biostats-r.github.io/biostats/quarto/04-figures-tables.html#equations)

In the template Introduction section take 3-4 minutes to write:

- a sub-heading under the introduction

- a list

- and an equation

- cite one of the articles in in existing `.bib` file using the `@`

- remove this callout  and render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom

# Libraries {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Generally it is good practice to include a list of packages you use up front. But you may not need to show them in the output or list them in the table of contents. The `{.unnumbered .unlisted}` commands following the heading remove this section from the table of contents but it will remain in the text. Quarto accepts multiple coding languages, the following example uses R. I have set up working R code chunks so that for this tutorial you do not need to be familiar with R. Here, we will experiment with a few code [execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).


If you want to use Python code check out the documentation [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#overview).


:::{.callout-tip}
# Code block exercise (5-7 minutes)

- Check out the [Block options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) and edit (and add to) the existing code block options below to:

 - exclude the results, messages and warnings

 - exclude the code from the HTML output

 - render the document and hit the :heavy_check_mark: in zoom
